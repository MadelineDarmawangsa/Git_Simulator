# Git_Simulator : Gitlet
A version-control system named Gitlet that mimics the basic functionality of Git, including commands such as init, add, commit, checkout, log, branch, rm, global-log, find, status, reset, merge, add-remote, rm-remote, push, fetch, and pull. Written from scratch in Java, this program was submitted as Project 3 for UC Berkeley's CS61B class "Data Structures" Spring 2022. This submission recieved full credit as well as full marks for extra credit assignment. To view the code, please contact me at madeline.ashley.d@gmail.com or refer to the links in my resume as academic integrity policies prohibit me from publicly posting it. 

In this implementation of the program, I utilized cryptographic hashing (similar to the way Git uses SHA-1 hashes), file persistence, hashmaps, and a combination of data structures.
